Shared Dependencies:

1. **React**: All the components will import React from 'react' package.

2. **PropTypes**: PropTypes will be used for type checking of props passed to components.

3. **axios**: This package will be used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.

4. **react-router-dom**: This package will be used for routing in the application.

5. **Exported Variables**: Each component will export its own function or class. For example, `RealTimeAnalysis.js` will export `RealTimeAnalysis` function, `DataInterpretation.js` will export `DataInterpretation` function, and so on.

6. **Data Schemas**: The data schemas will be defined in the backend API and will be shared with the frontend through API responses.

7. **DOM Element IDs**: Each component will have unique DOM element IDs for elements that need to be manipulated or accessed by JavaScript. For example, `RealTimeAnalysis` might have a `realTimeAnalysisContainer` ID for its main container, `DataInterpretation` might have a `dataInterpretationContainer` ID, and so on.

8. **Message Names**: Message names will be used for communication between components and can include names like `updateRealTimeAnalysis`, `updateDataInterpretation`, etc.

9. **Function Names**: Each component will have its own set of function names. For example, `RealTimeAnalysis` might have functions like `analyzeAudio`, `analyzeVideo`, `highlightEVPs`, etc. `DataInterpretation` might have functions like `interpretData`, `identifyPatterns`, `provideInsights`, etc.

10. **CSS Modules**: Each component will import its own CSS module for styling. For example, `RealTimeAnalysis.js` will import `RealTimeAnalysis.css`, `DataInterpretation.js` will import `DataInterpretation.css`, and so on.

11. **Common Components**: `Header.js` and `Footer.js` will be imported in `App.js` and will be shared across all the components.

12. **Package.json & Package-lock.json**: These files will contain the metadata of the project and will list all the dependencies used in the project.

13. **.gitignore**: This file will list the files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. This file is shared across the entire project.
